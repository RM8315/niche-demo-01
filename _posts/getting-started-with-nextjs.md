# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build modern web applications. In this post, we'll explore the key features and benefits of using Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a production-ready React framework that provides:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-built pages for optimal speed
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality alongside your frontend
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Optimized bundle sizes
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Styled components, CSS modules, and more

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system, making it intuitive to create new pages:

```
pages/
  index.js          // → /
  about.js          // → /about
  blog/
    [slug].js       // → /blog/:slug
```

### 2. Image Optimization

The `next/image` component automatically optimizes images for better performance:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
    />
  )
}
```

### 3. API Routes

Create API endpoints directly in your Next.js application:

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js application and start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its powerful features and developer experience make it a popular choice among React developers.

Happy coding!
