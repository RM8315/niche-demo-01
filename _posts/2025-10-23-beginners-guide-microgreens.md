# Beginner’s Guide to Microgreens: Grow Nutritious Sprouts at Home

Learn how to grow nutrient-dense microgreens at home with simple tools, tips, and safety advice — perfect for urban gardeners and busy cooks.

Microgreens are young vegetable greens harvested after the cotyledon leaves have developed. They pack a surprisingly large amount of flavor and nutrition into a tiny package, and they’re one of the easiest ways to add fresh greens to meals year-round.

## Why grow microgreens at home?

- High nutrition per bite: Several studies show microgreens can contain higher concentrations of vitamins and antioxidants compared with mature leaves (see a review on nutrients at the National Library of Medicine).
- Quick harvest: Most varieties are ready in 7–21 days, so you get fast results and multiple harvests per month.
- Minimal space: A sunny windowsill, a small tray, and a few seeds are all you need.

## What you’ll need (basic supplies)

- Seeds: Choose seeds labeled for microgreens or untreated salad varieties. Popular choices: radish, broccoli, sunflower, pea, basil, and beet.
- Shallow trays: 1–2 inch deep seed trays or recycled containers with drainage holes.
- Growing medium: Sterile seed-starting mix, coconut coir, or a soil-less mix.
- Light: A bright windowsill or an inexpensive full-spectrum LED grow light for consistent results.
- Watering tool: A fine-mist spray bottle or a gentle pour to avoid disturbing seedlings.

### Choosing seeds

Buy seeds from a reputable supplier and look for seeds sold specifically for microgreens or organic salad blends. Avoid seeds treated with pesticides or chemicals. Some seeds (like sunflower and pea) are sold hulled and ready for growing; they offer a meatier texture and higher yields.

## Step-by-step: How to grow microgreens

1. Prepare your tray: Fill a shallow tray with 1–1.5 inches of moist growing medium. Level the surface but don’t compact it.
2. Sow seeds evenly: Scatter seeds to form a dense but even layer. For tiny seeds like basil, aim for a thin, even cast; for larger seeds (sunflower), place them touching but not piled.
3. Press gently: Use a flat board or another tray to press seeds into the medium so they have good contact for germination.
4. Cover and darken (optional): Some growers cover trays with another tray or a humidity dome for 2–3 days to encourage even germination.
5. Provide light: Once most seeds have germinated, move the tray to bright, indirect light or under a grow light 12–16 hours per day.
6. Water carefully: Mist or water from below. Keep the medium damp but not waterlogged to prevent mold.
7. Harvest: Cut microgreens just above the soil line with scissors when the first true leaves appear (7–21 days depending on variety).

## Troubleshooting common problems

- Mold or damping-off: Often caused by poor air circulation or overwatering. Reduce humidity, increase airflow, and allow the surface to dry slightly between waterings. Use sterile trays and fresh medium.
- Uneven growth: Check light levels and seed density. Rotate trays for even exposure and thin seeds if overcrowded.
- Bitter taste: Some varieties are naturally peppery (radish, mustard). If bitterness is unwanted, try sweeter varieties like basil, sunflower, or pea shoots.

## Harvesting, storing, and using microgreens

Harvest in the morning for peak freshness. Use clean scissors to snip stems above the growing medium. Microgreens are best eaten fresh within a few days; store in a sealed container with a paper towel to absorb excess moisture and refrigerate.

Use microgreens to finish salads, sandwiches, grain bowls, soups, or as a colorful garnish. Their concentrated flavors make a small amount go a long way.

## Food safety: sprouts vs microgreens

Microgreens are grown on soil or a medium and harvested after leaves appear; they carry less risk than sprouted seeds (which are germinated in warm, wet conditions that can favor bacteria). Still, practice standard food-safety steps: use clean equipment, fresh water, and reputable seeds. For guidance on produce safety, consult USDA resources.

## Best varieties for beginners

- Radish: Fast, spicy, vibrant color; ready in 7–10 days.
- Broccoli: Mild flavor, highly nutritious; great for regular use.
- Sunflower: Meatier texture, nutty flavor, visually appealing.
- Pea shoots: Sweet, crisp, and easy to grow.
- Basil: Aromatic and adds instant flavor to dishes.

## Tips for consistent success

- Maintain consistent light: A regular light schedule helps uniform growth.
- Keep records: Track seed type, sow date, germination time, and harvest date to refine your process.
- Rotate crops: Stagger sowings every 7–10 days for a continual supply.

## Quick recipe ideas

- Microgreen pesto: Swap some basil for microgreens in a quick pesto for a fresh twist.
- Salad topper: Toss a handful of microgreens onto mixed greens with a citrus vinaigrette.
- Breakfast boost: Sprinkle microgreens over eggs or avocado toast for color and nutrients.

### Frequently asked questions

Q: How often can I harvest?
A: Stagger seedings every 7–10 days for continuous harvest.

Q: Can I reuse the growing medium?
A: It's best to compost spent medium and start fresh to reduce disease risk.

Q: Are microgreens worth growing indoors in winter?
A: Yes — with a simple LED grow light many growers produce reliable yields year-round.
